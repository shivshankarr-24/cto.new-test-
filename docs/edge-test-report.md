# Edge Resilience Test Report

## Executive Summary

A simulated edge environment was executed using the `simulation/run_edge_simulation.py` harness and accompanying automated unit tests located in `tests/`. The objectives were to validate autonomous operation during connectivity loss, secure update handling, and remote management workflows. All critical scenarios passed, demonstrating readiness for field trials.

## Test Matrix

| Test ID | Scenario | Description | Result |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| T-001 | Offline buffering | Disconnect backend for three cycles while ingesting sensor data, then restore connectivity. | ✅ Data flushed without loss. |
| T-002 | Secure update | Deliver signed update manifest, verify signature, apply update. | ✅ Version advanced, metrics emitted. |
| T-003 | Update rejection | Submit tampered manifest with invalid signature. | ✅ Update rejected, failure counter incremented. |
| T-004 | Remote command execution | Queue `capture_logs` command and validate response file. | ✅ Logs captured and stored. |
| T-005 | Cache pressure guard | Force cache beyond limit to ensure trimming. | ✅ Oldest entries pruned, service remained stable. |

## Detailed Results

### T-001 Offline Buffering
- **Method**: Unit test `test_agent_recovers_and_resyncs_after_outage`.
- **Observations**: Cache depth increased during outage, telemetry recorded offline duration. After backend recovery data was acknowledged and cache returned to 0.

### T-002 Secure Update
- **Method**: Unit test `test_secure_update_flow_validates_signature`.
- **Observations**: Agent validated HMAC signature before download. Metrics payload sent to backend contained `updates_applied=1`. Current version updated to `1.0.0`.

### T-003 Update Rejection
- **Method**: Manual test executed by modifying manifest signature; telemetry `update_failures` incremented. Cache unaffected.

### T-004 Remote Management
- **Method**: Unit test `test_remote_management_executes_commands_and_stores_results`.
- **Observations**: Command results persisted to `command-results.json`, including tail of `app.log`. Backend inventory endpoint invoked once per test run.

### T-005 Cache Pressure Guard
- **Method**: Manual invocation of simulation harness with artificially low cache limit.
- **Observations**: `OfflineCache.trim_to_limit` pruned old events to maintain footprint. No data corruption observed.

## Tooling

- **Simulation harness**: `python simulation/run_edge_simulation.py`
- **Unit tests**: `pytest`
- **Monitoring**: Metrics captured via in-memory backend emulator.

## Recommendations

- Extend simulator to integrate with real message broker (MQTT) for end-to-end throughput measurements.
- Add chaos testing to introduce random process crashes and validate systemd restart semantics.
- Instrument cache trimming events with structured logging for easier observability.
